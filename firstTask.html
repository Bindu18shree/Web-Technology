      <h2> Description</h2>
      
      <p> The Shih Tzu is a sturdy <del>little dog</del> <span> cute dog</span> with a small <mark>snout</mark> and normally has large dark brown eyes. <br/>The Chinese have described their head shapes as "owl head" and "lion head", and their mouth as "frog mouths" and their lips as "earthworm lips".[3] They have a soft and long double coat that will tangle and mat easily if not brushed at least every 2 or 3 days. A Shih Tzu should stand no more than 26.7 cm (101‚ÅÑ2") at the <mark>witherss</mark> and with an ideal weight of 4.0 to 7.5kg (9 to 17 lbs). Their floppy ears are covered with long hair, and their heavily hair-covered tail is carried curled over the back. The coat may be of any color, though white and with blazes of grey are frequently seen. A very noticeable feature is the underbite, which is required in the breed standard.</p>
